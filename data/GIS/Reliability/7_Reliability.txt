(7) Reliability

THERE IS CURRENTLY NO DATASET FOR RELIABILITY BECAUSE THE DATA WE HAVE IS PROPRIATARY AND CANNOT BE SHARED

RealiabilityGACountyYEAR.xlsx
Description: Reports grid reliability metrics (SAIDI and CMIN) for each GA county
Data Source: Poweroutage.us
Methodology: Cannot explicitly say, but SAIDI and CMIN are derived statistics from raw data 
Note: This source is proprietary and we can't provide a link to the raw data. Other reliability metrics can be provided beyond SAIDI and CMIN.
